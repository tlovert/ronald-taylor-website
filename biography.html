          <h1>Biography</h1>

          <p>Hello, my name is Ronald Taylor I am a Violinist for hire in the St.Louis area. 
            Let me tell you a little about myself, I currently perform in the University City, Webster University, and North Kirkwood Middle school orchestras.
             I started this business about a year ago to make some money because I wanted to buy a pair of shoes I had been saving up for. 
              I asked my  Mom for an allowance and she said,"I allow you to live here but I would help you make your own business" said Mom and together we made Master Violinist.
              So I made business cards and a website and we got started. I have had some great gigs so far some of which include a mansion on Lindell by the history museum, 
              the Americas center where the rams used to play, and the Crowne Plaza in downtown St. Louis. </p>
